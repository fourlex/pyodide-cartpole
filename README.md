# pyodide-cartpole

[DEMO](https://fourlex.github.io/pyodide-cartpole/)

This is an example of leveraging [Pyodide](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide) to run Python simulation code in the browser. Here I'm using cartpole simulation code written for a lab project in Python, Scipy and Numpy. I haven't modified the simulation code in any way to run it in the browser; the only new parts written in JS are visualization and minimal boilerplate interop code.
